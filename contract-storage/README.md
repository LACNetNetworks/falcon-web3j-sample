# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm init
npm install @lacchain/gas-model-provider --save
npm install ethers --save
npm install --save-dev hardhat

npx hardhat init

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat run scripts/deployContract.js

```
